I write posts about projects I have worked on, things I find interesting, and topics I have done research on and want
to save what I learned.

More about me can be found at my other site [mwtaylor.dev](mwtaylor.dev).

All the code for my projects is in GitHub which is linked on the left.

I sometimes post on Mastodon, also linked on the left. Topics include software development, food, movies, and news I 
find interesting. Also pictures of my dog!
